			<h2>About Me</h2>

			<p>Hello there! My name is Edward Chik, and I am currently an aspiring student with the Harvard Extension School who is hoping to enter the Masters of Information Technology program with a focus on <a href="http://www.extension.harvard.edu/degrees-certificates/information-technology/degree-requirements/concentrations#digital" target="_blank">Digital Media and Instructional Design</a>. My hope is that this will combine with my bachelor's degree in communications to form a strong educational foundation for my career in digital media.</p>

			<p>On a personal level, I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada where I still currently live. When I have some spare time, I enjoy spending it on hobbies such as video games, reading, writing, attending concerts and following sports (especially the business side, which has always been fascinating to me).</p>

		<!-- Code Editor for CSCI E-15 -->

			<h2>Code Editor</h2>

			<p>The code editor that I have chosen to use for CSCI E-15 is <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>, a small but very powerful editor that I was recently introduced to. After evaluating other options such as Notepad++ (which I use at my day job) and TextWrangler (which I used a little bit during Harvard Summer School), I decided to use Sublime Text 2 due to a combination of its preference in my other fall class (DGMD E-20) as well as a recommendation of the product by a co-worker who uses it regularly. I believe it offers me the right balance between power and ease of comprehension, I wanted a tool that was more sophisticated than Notepad but not as complex as a high level integrated development environment such as Eclipse (which is another popular option among programmers that I know).</p>
